# Getting Started with Create React App

This repository contains code for a web application that allows users to search for images related to a given term. The application features a search bar where users can enter their search term, and it returns a list of images related to that term.

The application is built using React and leverages a third-party image search API to fetch the images. The code is well-organized and follows best practices for React development, with reusable components and clear separation of concerns.


To run the application, clone this repository to your local machine and run the npm start command. The application will be served on http://localhost:3000.

Steps to run this github repo:
- clone this repository
